# Kronos
Kronos is a standalone Python desktop app that helps users that struggle to focus on important things allocate their time and evaluate their successes and failures at following their plans. Kronos lets users identify events and tasks occurring on any particular day and pull events from their Google Calendar to integrate multiple schedules into one. All events are marked by identifiers, start and end times, and what time the events ACTUALLY started and ended, to be filled in at the end of the day. Calendars render dynamically based on the type and success of making events on time. Kronos also allows users to generate breakdowns of their events and minutes spent throughout the day, identifying patterns of lateness or early finishes that users can take into account making future plans. Feel like the god for whom the tool is named!
